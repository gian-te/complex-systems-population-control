Wolf-Cow population simulation

The model simulates the behavior between predator and prey populations. In this model, we are using wolves and cows as predators and preys, respectively. However, it can be changed to other predator-prey relationships.

The wolves have an initial count of 5, 

The cows have an initial number of 10,

The grass have an initial number of 20 and has a respawn time of 60 time units.

Wolves and cows have a fixed rate to reproduce at each unit of time- 5%. When reproducing, wolves and cows produce an offspring. 

More information about the model, the requirements, and opportunities to extend the model can be found in the Info tab of the model.
